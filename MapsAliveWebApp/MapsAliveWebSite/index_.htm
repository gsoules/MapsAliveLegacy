			The MapsAlive web site is temporarily unavailable because of maintenance.
			<br />
			<br />
			<b>Tours you created with MapsAlive will still work</b> (they are not affected by site maintenance).
			<br />
			<br />
			The site is available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  Well, almost...
			<br />
			<br />
			Every so often we have to perform maintenance to make improvements.
			<br />
			We apologize for any inconvenience this causes you.
