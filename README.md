# MapsAliveLegacy
MapsAlive Legacy Edition

MapsAlive lets you make any image interactive. Your “map” can be anything: a floor plan,
diagram, photograph, drawing, or a stylized or historical geographic map. An interactive
map can display photos and text, play videos or sound, and even draw routes between
locations on the map.

MapsAlive was originally developed, marketed, and sold as a commercial product.
It was developed by George Soules of AvantLogic Corporation. The commercial product
will be sunsetted effective January 1, 2027, but the legacy source code for the web application
is now available as open source for those who might benefit from seeing the underlying
implementation, or who have interest in hosting a private copy of the software on their
own server for use solely by their organization.
