MapsAlive Legacy Edition

MapsAlive lets you make any image interactive. Your “map” can be anything: a floor plan,
diagram, photograph, drawing, or a stylized or historical geographic map. An interactive
map can display photos and text, play videos or sound, and even draw routes between
locations on the map.

MapsAlive was originally marketed, and sold as the commercial product [mapsalive.com](https://www.mapsalive.com).
It was developed by George Soules and Janice Kenyon of AvantLogic Corporation.

The commercial product will be sunsetted effective January 1, 2027, but the legacy source code
for the web application is available here for commerical MapsAlive customers
who need to coninue using the application after it expires on December 31, 2026.

It is called the legacy edition to distinguish it from the commercial software
which has additional components such as a shopping cart which are not included here.
